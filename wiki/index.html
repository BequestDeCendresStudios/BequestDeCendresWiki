      <h2>Inspiration</h2>
<p>riginally as a creator what first got me into science fiction and fantasy was Final Fantasy 7 Advent Children. I vastly preferred the way Advent Children did romance compared to the way previous final fantasies approached, but with one particular exception: I always found their approach when it came to reviving Aerith Gainsborough completely inconsistent with what they used to do in the past, noteably FF6:</p>
<p>Rachel could be brought back if certain conditions are met, but only for like a day, and thereby maintaining the darker atmosphere generally, while still giving Locke something to live for.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of changes in my worldview sense that point. I got into reading the Anarchist library, and also briefly became involved with The Satanic Temple ( that's an entire story onto itself ). But also used to listen to Goth Rock music more frequently around the same time I played FF7. Although this changed after I got into the Cyberpunk genre in general. About nine novels, 40+ poems, and a few essays later, I'm slowly returning to my roots in the interest in the gothic and sublime.</p>
<p>But my stories I write are quite different from the way Square Enix handles romance, more often than not my female characters ( with the exception being the MC herself ) is often dead when the story begins, with Hemato ( or spiritual successors ) desiring oblivion and self-termination. This create a distinctively different kind of vibe even from darker Squeenix stuff.</p>
<p>Recently this particular game I'm working on, combines elements of the Grandia series and Shadow Hearts ( do not confuse this for Kingdom Hearts, they're quite different ). I've also had some people compare my music to Persona, Goth Rock, and Black Metal.</p>
<p>I'm not quite sure how this interactive fiction will turn out.</p>
<h2>What Is Yumemoire</h2>
<p>Yumemoire - A method of overlapping dream-worlds that create ripples in reality; a type of fabric that enables overlapping dreams. Specifically, this fabric often takes over the fabric of Balcony windows, similar to novels like Peter Pan. With the main distinction being that in the future, such fabric is also harnessed by technology to influence people at the subconscious level.</p>
<p>To learn more about moire patterns: Moire Patterns</p>
<h3>Yume No Ninja</h3>
<p>A specialize division of espionage known as &quot;Yume No Ninja&quot;, &quot;Yume no supai&quot;, or simply Dream-Scanners, operate outside the oversight of governments. They have become both proficient in Japanese and French language, do to the strong economic ties between both countries. Do to the nature of dreams having different physical laws from reality, a set of guidelines around exploring the Yumemoire, the dream lands, aids travelers exploration without losing their sanity, and becoming political dissidents.</p>
<p>But such power is often abused.</p>
<h3>Prototype For Dreamspace / Frontierspace</h3>
<p>Eventually Yumemoire is able to be harnessed at the electro-chemical level, and used as an alternative to virtual reality. The main distinction between Dreamspace and Frontierspace, is that Frontierspace often overlaps with genre tropes in Western fiction, with dreams being a final frontier between the real world and the world of the dead.</p>
<h3>World Of The Dead</h3>
<p>The world of the dead is an end state where dreams develop symbolism from Gothic fiction. Vampire, whom evolved away from humanity, thrive in this region. Where queens of the dead rule like Zombie Queens, and able to manipulate the real world at an subconcious level. Those who develop &quot;blood fetishism&quot;, are manipulated by such zombie queens.</p>
<p>Implications For Gameplay</p>
<h2>Reincarnation Myth</h2>
<p>Reincarnation at its core works by the death of ones original body prompting the &quot;limbo&quot; body to reinhabit the duplicate body.</p>
<p>Often said duplicate body will be in a child version of the adult body, and is considered a dictinct entity from ones offspring.</p>
<p>You offspring, if you have them, is tasked with guided your &quot;limbo&quot; body to the new body.</p>
<p>In general the duplicate body will be made by a priest in the town you currently reside in. And thus those whom travel a bit will often be switcehd to the duplicate body after the death on a previous adventure in the new town they visited.</p>
<p>Here the goal becomes less ending the cycle of reincarnation, but rather learning from ones mistakes in a previous incarnation. Those whom were executed a lot of previous bodies, are considered &quot;bad omens&quot;, while those whom died of old age, and considered the best &quot;good omens&quot;.</p>
<h3>SOURCES OF HORROR ALA BAD OMENS</h3>
<p>Being unable to secure a duplicate body as a punishment. – dark preist / revenge<br />
A lack of children to care for the duplicate. – infertility / stillbirth.<br />
Having a child whom had a grunge against the adult version. – executioner of Karma<br />
Town with duplicate body is abandoned, leaving duplicate unattended. – prisoner in black</p>
<p>Generally such storytellers are those on their way out, or constantly bedridden. Whom seek to warn society about the dark preist, the stillborn baby, the executioner of karma, and the prisoner in black who can sometimes be found in abandoned town, usually as a result of disaster like a collapsed mineshaff. Often you will also have anti-thesis to the main bad omens: preist in white, the infant, the warden in white, among other assistance.</p>
<p>The dark preist is nuetralized by the preist in white, the stillborn is nuetralized by duplicate infant, the warden can free the prisoner in black.</p>
<h2>Shinshusci - Scientific Mysticism</h2>
<p>The science of this world of mythology around death and reincarnation will work in tandem to produce a kind of scientific mysticism. When you look at the naming conventions of enemies this becomes clear:</p>
<h3>Anos Tsuchi Tesutosujettos de les corrompue</h3>
<p>Test subject of corrupting soil. Test subjects like these are subject to experiments related to Earth magic, that imbues with the ability to leverage Earth magic. For those unfamiliar with my work, note that Duststorms are a stand in for a specific kind of Earth magic specific to deserts.</p>
<h3>Ana Tsuchi Ursinehomme de la noyee</h3>
<p>The name is a little bit confusing, but when you combine Earth and drowning, this suggests a bear-man whose is the reincarnation of man whom died in quicksand, or similar unusual circumstances.</p>
<h3>Origin Of Naming Convention</h3>
<p>These names are an evolution of the fantasy language I'm developing that can be described Francais that's taken inspiration from Japanese, specifically by creating pseudo word classes to distinguish words loaned from Japanese into Francais. These particular names come from a method of generating names based on the rules of this particular fantasy language.</p>
<h2>Yokanozen - Systematic Supernatural</h2>
<h3>Word Meaning</h3>
<p>Literally Before leisure or Four Advances; In practice means systematic appearance of strange apparitions in environments that are to quiet, that it lets your imagination take over. As a point of comparison, usually one encounters only one Yokai if one dies with a strong negative emotion. Some area naturally tend to concentrate strange apparitions with strong emotions, like places near maritime disasters.</p>
<h3>Use In Practice</h3>
<p>Most likely this I will develop maps and locations with a great deal of history behind them that make it more likely to have particular concentrations of certain types of Yokai, based on these magical elements:</p>
<pre><code>    9ADEF4 Air / Float / flotteur
    397A8E Water / Drowning / noyee
    A9A85F Sand / Duststorm / tempête de poussières
    56756C Moss / Poison / dokubutsu
    3C3733 Stone / Corruption / oshoko
    1F1F21 Death / Void / void
    FFFFFF Recovery / Healing / habu
    2B2A2B Union / Combining Elements / yunion
</code></pre>
<p>For instance one based on flotteur based by an abandoned beach that is littered with procedural generated naval ships that crashed near the coast.</p>
<h2>Viola Matraque / Inhorei Noyee</h2>
<p>Inhorei Noyee is a euphemism for a type of institution that practices subjecting people to drowning experiments in areas based on the aforementioned magical elements.</p>
<p>Viola Matraque is a special weapon that combines the elements of a violin with a hammer so that a maid or her assistance can use the viola to appease restless spirits, or bludgeon zombies and other monsters that I still need to brain storm.</p>
<h2>Le Kumabatto De Les Ghoules</h2>
<p>There is was a bit of a situation with the way a friend was interpreting the name of these beast, where mythologically speaking it can be thought of as the ghoul or vampire of were bears, whom take on a human silhouette form at night, and those whom give them protection in this vulnerable state, are rewarded as being queens of the underworld.</p>
<p>However a friend of mine interpreted that as &quot;Bear-Sword Of Ghoules&quot;, which in context kind of makes sense, as a reward for protecting a were bear in their human form.</p>
<p>The idea is that it would drain the life force from enemies, and also heal the player, but at the cost of their own sanity.</p>
<h1>Glossary</h1>
<h2>Digital Burial</h2>
<p>Inhumation De Dejitaru Literally &quot;Digital Burial&quot;, to specifically means a digital archive of ones life's work prior to cremation.</p>
<h3>Le Inhumation De Le Payee De Anos Hon Teddos</h3>
<p>[ Inpahote ] Burial in haunted countryside.</p>
<h3>Use Case</h3>
<p>These concept paintings, scripts, and prototypes will flesh out this particular world and setting that I've been building that mark something of a return to gothic fiction, while retaining some elements of Dreampunk fiction. Here they will flesh out the concept of &quot;Digital Burial&quot; or &quot;Bequest De Cendres&quot;, literally &quot;Legacy Of Ashes&quot;.</p>
<h2>Raitosalle De Getawaltz</h2>
<p>These will be special enemies I'm developing that manifest as dancing flashlights in the darkness with no specific form they have their own, whom represent the restless spirits of those whom have not secured a &quot;Karada Duplicata&quot;.</p>
<p>Here Karada Duplicata is a duplicate body made in the image of a Porcelain Doll, think something akin to Okiku, but more designed after Belle Epoque France. Those whom don't secure a body become &quot;Raitto De Getawaltz&quot;.</p>
<h3>Getawaltz</h3>
<p>Getawaltz is a portmanteau that conveys combines traditional Waltz dancing with wooden shoes, which can be either based on Sabots or Geta depending on the context.</p>
<h2>Lunar Calender Mechanics</h2>
<p>The current direction for Bequest De Cendres is making the sanity meter more intrinsically tied with the lunar mechanics established, rather than have sanity be its own separate thing.</p>
<p>The primary reasons for that is the eventual direction for the game is to have much of the game-play revolve more explicitly around the lunar calendar system while I flesh out how example the procedural family tree system works, as its already evolving beyond the original concept for Yumemoire.</p>
<p>I'm still undecided at the moment whether I'm going to feature Bear-Men as prominently as in Yumemoire, or if I should branch this off into its own game, while I work on finishing Yumemoire.</p>
<p>The planned mechanics is as follows: the sanity meter follows the same increment and decrement patterns as HP does, making sanity a fourth separate metric the player must keep track of. Rather than a time limit, you have to do things that restore your sanity to prevent being turned into an Eldritch Abomination.</p>
<p>I'm also still decided on how exactly to use zombie mechanics, or if I should stick exclusively to granular autonomous player control like I've been working on.</p>
<h2>Kyabin Yokanozen</h2>
<p>Cabin before leisure; haunted cabin. Essentially a cabin that is particularly known for concentrating strange apparitions that act as a cultural history book that combines French and Japanese folklore.</p>
<h2>Ceriderinshos</h2>
<p>Hospitals and clinics that become yokanozen after strange events. Generally this places differ from standard Japanese folklore, in that there is a large number of strange apparitions that appear in certain haunted areas, blurring the line between Japanese Horror and Western Ghost Stories.</p>
<h2>Seigyo Des Dommmages</h2>
<p>The general term for damage control; generally used in context with fixing leaks in battleships and other vessels. But has also been used to describe companies massively rewriting a canon or doing other conceptual work that massively divides the fan base.</p>
<p>Usually such social issues are preventable by making sure first and foremost stories maintain a thematic consistency with other titles, even if the work takes on a generally grim tone. For example, if one establishes that dust storm is a substitute for normal Earth magic, then its imperative to make sure each title's lore makes dust storm the regular replacement for Earth magic through out a franchise.</p>
<h2>Sanitemetoruho</h2>
<p>A measurement based on your present mental fragility compared and contrasting with the trust level other party members and love interest have in you as the protagonist. This allows for more dynamic levels of bad endings rather than one standard Survival Horror ending.</p>
<h2>Sakabekige</h2>
<p>Derived from [ Sangkabegaki ].</p>
<p>To express ones love so deeply, that you'd rather end it all by writing &quot;I Love You&quot; on a wall. Such places are generally places closest to where the lovers first met, with games that revolve around them being about the depression of one of &quot;Sangkabegaki&quot; creativity.</p>
<h2>Sombreheiwa</h2>
<p>A run where you meet game play goals by relieving enemies burden, with the &quot;sombre&quot; stemming from why they lashed out. Ex. A dragon trying to fend you off to protect its hatchling dying of a terminal illness. Expect more tear jerking than you normal peaceful ending without any explicit tragedy.</p>
<p>Note this assumes a game where sanity alters what dialogue graph is available, and thereby what kinds of endings are possible. In theory this means its possible you could get ending where you don't slay any monster, and yet they still die despite relieving their burdens.</p>
<h2>Anos Pluiebutos</h2>
<p>Literally translates to &quot;Rain boots&quot;, but more specifically raining boots. &quot;It's raining wooden shoes&quot;, in a context similar to while people will fly in the sky in their car, even though it's not designed to fly like an airplane.</p>
<p>But also can be used metaphorically to me to insinuate something bad is happening, that is comparably historically traumatic to the long and protracted civil war that created the cultural dynamics to begin with.</p>
<h2>Anos Mibojinjos - ( Mibojinju )</h2>
<p>An automated crossbow designed for executing murderers by beheading them. This is done behind closed doors in dead up blocks in prisons. This came about from needing a fast way to get rid of political prisoners, but with the effiency of guillotining them.</p>
<h1>Gameplay Elements</h1>
<h2>Elemental Weaknesses</h2>
<p>I'm increasingly going in the direction of having elemental weakness based self-modifying decision tree that tracks magical elements, the monsters susceptibility, and the confidence strength.</p>
<p>This original inspiration here was when i was playing Grandia, and noted how different special moves and magical skills had strength meters. This would go further by assigning a probability strength value to these metrics.</p>
<p>Uncertainties: I'm not sure how these is going to work in tandem with the deity worship system I'm developing: Dakupreiste, Mort Naussance, Borreau De Karma, and Horyo De Noir.</p>

<h2>Game State Restructuring</h2>
